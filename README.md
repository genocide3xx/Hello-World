# Hello-World
First Github repository, mostly for brainstorming

My name is Ian Ford, this is my first Github project. This will mainly be used for coming up with ideas about upcoming projects and gathering other collaborators.

First project is a statistics management program in python v3.0. The program will take a character and track it stats and print out a basic character stat sheet for a role-playing game i have developed. It will track the stats and experience earned for a player and increase stats accordingly.
